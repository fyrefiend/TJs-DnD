# Basic info on the campaign
## Ground rules for characters:

 - Evil characters are discouraged. I may allow them but not if they're going to be murder hobos.
 - We're using the XP system for level advancement.
 - Please attempt to give your character a back story: Why are they adventuring? Where did they learn their class?
 - Personality Traits, Ideals, Flaws, and Bonds are required

### Races:
 - You may be any race from the books I've shared other than: Simic Hybrid.
 - If you want to be a human variant get with me and we can work together so it's not game breaking.
 - You can be exotic races but you must actually role play it and deal with the possible consequences. i.e.- If you want to be a Drow and we're in a desert you'll need to deal with the fact that you'll be in constant sunlight.
 - Ways races are different from canon:
     - Dwarves can not be Wizards or Sorcerers. They can be Warlocks and Artificers.
     - ortles live for an average of 500 years, not 50. In this world they do have settlements though many still wander.
### Money and equipment
 - I do use encumbrance for equipment but not for coinage, within reason: a few hundred gp, don't sweat it but if you find a dragon's hoard you're not just carrying it all out.
 - I used pp, gp, sp, and cp. We're not playing with electrum.
 - I do care about rations and water but it's mostly on the honor system.
 - Same with ammo
 - Don't bother with lifestyle. I'm assuming that during downtime between adventures you have modest but comfortable places to stay. If you want something more then we can work something out.
 - I do allow simple firearms but they are far from perfect. On a Critical miss they have a chance of exploding!

## Cosmology
 - Ignore the Eberron setting's cosmology. We're using the standard Great Wheel model found in the PHB.
 - *If* we ever decide to Spell Jam we are using 2nd E's crystal spheres and phlogiston, **not** the astral sea.
