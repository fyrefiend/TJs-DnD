## Session 1
We are in the city of Sharn. The characters individually are summoned to Lyrander Tower on the Upper Central Plateau by Guard **Sargeant Germaine Valroy** and given the mission to meet a warforged named **Coal** in a warforged bar called the Cog Carnival.  
When the characters go to meet him Coal is spooked by the party and makes a run for it. When the party follows they find that Coal as been jumped by a **Daask** hit squad. After defeating the goons Coal tells the party about how his friend Razor was hired by **Alden d'Orien** for a secret mission. After a few weeks Razor told Coal the job was harder than expected. Now Razor is dead.
