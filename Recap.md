# Game Recaps
## Session 1
We are in the city of Sharn. The characters individually are summoned to Lyrander Tower on the Upper Central Plateau by Guard **Sergeant Germaine Valroy** and given the mission to meet a warforged named **Coal** in a warforged bar called the Cog Carnival.  
When the characters go to meet him Coal is spooked by the party and makes a run for it. When the party follows they find that Coal as been jumped by a **Daask** hit squad. After defeating the goons Coal tells the party about how his friend Razor was hired by **Alden d'Orien** for a secret mission. After a few weeks Razor told Coal the job was harder than expected. Now Razor is dead. The party brings Coal back to the Sergeant who asks the party to investigate what's going on with d'Orien..

The party travels to the **Mythral Tower** section of the cite to meet with **Alden d'Orien** and his trusted Kalashtar assistant **Vashtai** at his estate. He tells the party his son **Caden** was kidnapped. A Half-Ogre named **Garra** working for the **Daask** tells Alden that if he ever wants to see his son alive again he needs to hire and send Warforged to a dig site in the under city and use the resources of House Orien to move whatever they dig up. Alden asks the party to save his son. When they agree he points them to a lift that will take them down.  
When the party gets to the dig site Eltri goes to free Caden while the rest of the party fight off the goblin and hobgoblin guards. Despite some friendly fire from Kentucky the party kills the guards, rescues Caden, and frees the Warforged workers.  
They return to Alden's estate and reunite father and son. Alden offers the hospitality of his house and asks the party to track down Garra and their evil plans.
