# Game Recaps
## Session 1
We are in the city of Sharn. The characters individually are summoned to Lyrander Tower on the Upper Central Plateau by Guard **Sergeant Germaine Valroy** and given the mission to meet a warforged named **Coal** in a warforged bar called the Cog Carnival.  
When the characters go to meet him Coal is spooked by the party and makes a run for it. When the party follows they find that Coal as been jumped by a **Daask** hit squad. After defeating the goons Coal tells the party about how his friend Razor was hired by **Alden d'Orien** for a secret mission. After a few weeks Razor told Coal the job was harder than expected. Now Razor is dead. The party brings Coal back to the Sergeant who asks the party to investigate what's going on with d'Orien.

The party travels to the **Mythral Tower** section of the cite to meet with **Alden d'Orien** and his trusted Kalashtar assistant **Vashtai** at his estate. He tells the party his son **Caden** was kidnapped. A Half-Ogre named **Garra** working for the **Daask** tells Alden that if he ever wants to see his son alive again he needs to hire and send Warforged to a dig site in the under city and use the resources of House Orien to move whatever they dig up. Alden asks the party to save his son. When they agree he points them to a lift that will take them down.  
When the party gets to the dig site Eltri goes to free Caden while the rest of the party fight off the goblin and hobgoblin guards. Despite some friendly fire from Kentucky the party kills the guards, rescues Caden, and frees the Warforged workers.  
They return to Alden's estate and reunite father and son. Alden offers the hospitality of his house and asks the party to track down Garra and stop their evil plans.
## Session 2
The next morning the party woke and Alden fills them in on the location of Garra (Terminus transportation tower) and offers the party the help of Oblex to help take her down. As they left the tower Valroy (or someone who looks like Valroy) pulls up in a skycoach offering them a ride. While they are flying along the party sees they are being trailed by 5 gnolls on floating disks. At the same time the party notices that "Vilroy" is actually a changeling. In the ensuing battle the changeling is knocked out and the skycoach propulsion crystal is damaged. After defeating the gnolls the party works out how to control the coach's controls, other than propulsion. As they approach the tower Tuck mistakenly breaks the propulsion crystal but they manage to dock anyway. Once safely on docked they search the changeling and find a note that says to take the party to Terminus to be ambushed. Olga uses her disguise kit and the armor from the changeling to make Eltri look like Valroy.  
The party heads down a level in the tower and break into an inocent magewright's apartment. There they find out that there were loud bangs and screaming from the apartment next door. Eltri fixes the magewright's door and they break into the apartment next door. When they enter they find that the room is trashed. When some of the party sits on the couch they get jumped by a bunch of kenkus. During the ensuing battle Olga ends up passing a dagger back and forth with one of the kenku before whipping themselves in the ass, which causes another kenku to become distracted enough to stab itself in the leg. The party quickly finishes off the rest of them.
